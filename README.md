# multipage require example

The project shows how to set up a multi-page requirejs-based project that has the following goals:
- each page is consisted of common modules and page specific modules

- all the pages have the same requirejs configuration

- a client side template engine like Handlebars.js or underscore.js can be loaded to have a bit of client side rendering

## Build and run the example:
```
npm install
npm run build:dev
npm start
```
